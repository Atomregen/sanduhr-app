Atomregen's Hourglass Project

All files located in the micropython folder must be copied to the esp32, which must be running micropython.

The hourglass is controlled via Bluetooth; the web app is available at: https://atomregen.github.io/sanduhr-app/

All files not located in the /micropython/lib/ folder were created using Google Gemini AI.
